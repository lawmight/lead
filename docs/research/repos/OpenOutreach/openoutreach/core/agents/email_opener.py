"""Email opener agent: composes the single Layer-1 cold email for a deal.

A distinct entrypoint from the follow-up agent. Layer 1 email is one outbound
touch — no thread to read, no send/wait/give-up decision — so the structured
output is just a subject + body. The prompt shares the outreach base (identity,
product docs, lead summary, Mom Test strategy, language/no-placeholder rules) via
``email_opener.j2`` and only adds the cold-email framing + the subject request.
The multi-turn email conversation is the hosted Layer-2 backend's job.
