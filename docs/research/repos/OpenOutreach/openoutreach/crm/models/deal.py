class DealState(models.TextChoices):
    """OpenOutreach-owned funnel state for a Deal.

    OpenOutreach owns these values, not linkedin_cli. The library's connect/status
    verbs only *observe* three of them off the LinkedIn UI — QUALIFIED, PENDING,
    CONNECTED — and hand them back as plain strings over the CLI boundary; every
    other state is written only here: READY_TO_CONNECT (passed the GP threshold),
    the email fork (READY_TO_EMAIL/EMAILED), and COMPLETED/FAILED (outcome). The
    three UI-observed string values match the library's so lifting a returned
    string into this enum is a plain ``DealState(value)`` lookup at the boundary.

    Email channel: enrichment is a *router*, not a gate, and the route is an
    explicit FSM fork — the state *is* the routing:

        HIT  ─▶ READY_TO_EMAIL ─(EMAIL task)─▶ EMAILED   (Layer-1 quasi-terminal)
        MISS ─▶ stays QUALIFIED ─(GP gate)─▶ READY_TO_CONNECT ─▶ … ─▶ CONNECTED

    On a finder hit the qualify router transitions QUALIFIED → READY_TO_EMAIL (a
    cheap, *ungated* send-queue — any qualified lead with an address, FIFO, paced
    only by the per-box cap; unlike READY_TO_CONNECT it is NOT a GP confidence
    gate). The single Layer-1 send moves it to EMAILED, a quasi-terminal state
    that rests until a human sets an Outcome (no inbound reading yet). A miss,
    finder-off, or couldn't-run leaves the deal QUALIFIED so the GP gate can
    promote it to READY_TO_CONNECT — its only door — and the connection harvests
    contact info on acceptance. The two fork states encode the one-shot guarantee
    in the state column: the email pool holds only READY_TO_EMAIL, so a deal is
    sent exactly once and can never double-send.
